Computational Fluid Dynamics Research | LSU Cain Department of Chemical Engineering                        June 2020 – Present

Explored Research Problems: 
*“Hydrodynamic Interaction of a Collection of a Periodic Array of Elliptical Particles in Shear Flow with Limited Mobility,” 
Presented at the 15th International Conference on Gas-Liquid-Solid Reactor Engineering, University of Ottawa (August 2022)

*Numerical Simulation of Reverse and Forward Cascading Phenomena

*Induced Vortex Development in a Channel Flow Domain to explore the effects of a splitter plate on Drag and Lift forces

*Automation.py is code generated allowing automation of running simulations in the open-source software OpenFoam along with the necessarly files from an add-on
called SDFIBM.

*PostProcessing.py is a python file which always data analysis and graphical representation from fluid probe points in a specific domain in this computational software.
